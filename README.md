## Description

An xUnit family unit testing framework for Ruby.

test-unit (Test::Unit) is unit testing framework for Ruby, based on xUnit
principles. These were originally designed by Kent Beck, creator of extreme
programming software development methodology, for Smalltalk's SUnit. It allows
writing tests, checking results and automated testing in Ruby.

## Features

* test-unit 1.2.3 is the original test-unit, taken
  straight from the ruby distribution. It is being
  distributed as a gem to allow tool builders to use it as a
  stand-alone package. (The test framework in ruby is going
  to radically change very soon).

* test-unit will be improved actively and may break
  compatiblity with test-unit 1.2.3. (We will not hope it
  if it isn't needed.)

* Some features exist as separated gems like GUI test
  runner. (Tk, GTK+ and Fox) test-unit-full gem package
  provides for installing all test-unit related gems
  easily.
